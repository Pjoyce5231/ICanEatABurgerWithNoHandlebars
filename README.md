# ICanEatABurgerWithNoHandlebars

+ I created this application for people who love burgers!
+ Type in the name of a burger and add the burger into the time to eat section of the page.
+ once you've added that burger into time to eat, you can devour that burger!
+ Once the burger is devoured, then it will move from the time to eat column over into the devoured column
